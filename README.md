# UEBA Anomaly Detection

 Project Overview
This project is a **User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)** system built in Python.  
It uses **machine learning (scikit-learn)** to learn patterns of normal user activity and then detect deviations (anomalies) that may indicate **insider threats or suspicious behavior**.  

The goal is to simulate a lightweight security analytics tool that helps reduce risks by automatically flagging abnormal activity.

 Expected Output
- Trains on normal user activity logs.  
- Identifies unusual behavior (anomalies) and flags them.  
- Provides basic accuracy metrics and false-positive reduction techniques.  

Sample Output:
```
Training completed...
Detection Accuracy: 94.2%
False Positive Rate: 3.1%
Flagged anomalies saved in anomalies.csv
```
